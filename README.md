<h1>Contingency Tables</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project is based off of the textbook "Extending the Linear Model with R" by Julian J. Faraway. These are exercises completed based off of Chapter 6: Contingency Tables, where I compute contingency tables, create plots, and calculate chi-squared tests based on the data given. Two-way proportion tables and two-way tables for deviance residuals are also used to analyze the data.
